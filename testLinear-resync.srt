00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,051
In this lesson, we're going to
be talking about finance. And

2
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:12,000
one of the most important aspects
of finance is interest.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,962
When I go to a bank or some
other lending institution

4
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:18,910
to borrow money, the bank is happy
to give me that money. But then I'm

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,859
going to be paying the bank for the
privilege of using their money. And that

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,795
amount of money that I pay the bank is
called interest. Likewise, if I put money

7
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:32,731
in a savings account or I purchase a
certificate of deposit, the bank just

8
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:36,679
doesn't put my money in a little box
and leave it there until later. They take

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,615
my money and lend it to someone
else. So they are using my money.

10
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:45,564
The bank has to pay me for the privilege
of using my money.

11
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:49,513
Now what makes banks
profitable is the rate

12
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:54,449
that they charge people to use the bank's
money is higher than the rate that they

13
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:01,359
pay people like me to use my money. The
amount of interest that a person pays or

14
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,282
earns is dependent on three things. It's
dependent on how much money is involved.

15
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:12,218
It's dependent upon the rate of interest
being paid or the rate of interest being

16
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:18,141
charged. And it's also dependent upon
how much time is involved. If I have

17
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:23,077
a loan and I want to decrease the amount
of interest that I'm going to pay, then

18
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm either going to have to decrease how
much money I borrow, I'm going to have

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,949
to borrow the money over a shorter period
of time, or I'm going to have to find a

20
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:37,885
lending institution that charges a lower
interest rate. On the other hand, if I

21
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:41,833
want to earn more interest on my
investment, I'm going to have to invest

22
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:46,769
more money, leave the money in the
account for a longer period of time, or

23
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:49,731
find an institution that will pay
me a higher interest rate.
