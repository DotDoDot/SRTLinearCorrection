00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this lesson, we're going to
be talking about finance. And

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
one of the most important aspects
of finance is interest.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When I go to a bank or some
other lending institution

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to borrow money, the bank is happy
to give me that money. But then I'm

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
going to be paying the bank for the
privilege of using their money. And that

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
amount of money that I pay the bank is
called interest. Likewise, if I put money

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in a savings account or I purchase a
certificate of deposit, the bank just

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
doesn't put my money in a little box
and leave it there until later. They take

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
my money and lend it to someone
else. So they are using my money.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The bank has to pay me for the privilege
of using my money.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now what makes banks
profitable is the rate

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that they charge people to use the bank's
money is higher than the rate that they

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
pay people like me to use my money. The
amount of interest that a person pays or

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
earns is dependent on three things. It's
dependent on how much money is involved.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's dependent upon the rate of interest
being paid or the rate of interest being

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
charged. And it's also dependent upon
how much time is involved. If I have

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
a loan and I want to decrease the amount
of interest that I'm going to pay, then

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm either going to have to decrease how
much money I borrow, I'm going to have

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to borrow the money over a shorter period
of time, or I'm going to have to find a

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
lending institution that charges a lower
interest rate. On the other hand, if I

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
want to earn more interest on my
investment, I'm going to have to invest

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
more money, leave the money in the
account for a longer period of time, or

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
find an institution that will pay
me a higher interest rate.
